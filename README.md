# Zora Auction House

This repository contains the contracts that compose the Zora Auction House.

The contracts aim to provide an open system for anyone to perform an auction, with special emphasis given to the role of curators.

## Architecture
This protocol allows a holder of a Zora NFT to create and perform
a permissionless reserve auction. It also acknowledges the role of
curators in auctions, and optionally allows the auction creator to 
dedicate a portion of the winnings from the auction to a curator of their choice.

Note that if a curator is specified, the curator decides when to start the auction. 
Additionally, the curator is able to cancel an auction before it begins.

### Create Auction
At any time, the holder of a token can create an auction. When an auction is created,
the token is moved out of their wallet and held in escrow by the auction. The owner can 
retrieve the token at any time, so long as the auction has not begun.

### Cancel Auction
If an auction has not started yet, the curator or the creator of the auction may cancel the auction, and remove it from the registry. 
This action returns the token to the previous holder.

| **Name**               | **Type**       | **Description**                                                                                |
|------------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `tokenContract`        | `address`      | The address of the nft contract the token is from                                              |
| `tokenId`              | `uint256`      | The tokenID to cancel the auction for                                                          |

### Set Auction Approval
If a created auction specifies a curator to start the auction, the curator _must_ approve it in order for it to start.
This is to allow curators to specifically choose which auctions they are willing to curate and perform.

| **Name**               | **Type**       | **Description**                                                                                |
|------------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `tokenContract`        | `address`      | The address of the nft contract the token is from                                              |
| `tokenId`              | `uint256`      | The tokenID for the auction approval                                                           |
| `approved`             | `bool`         | The approval state to set on the auction                                                       |

### Create Bid
If an auction is approved, anyone is able to bid. The first bid _must_ be greater than the reserve price. 
Once the first bid is successfully placed, other bidders may continue to place bids up until the auction's duration has passed.

If a bid is placed in the final 15 minutes of the auction, the auction is extended for another 15 minutes. 

| **Name**               | **Type**       | **Description**                                                                                |
|------------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `tokenContract`        | `address`      | The address of the nft contract the token is from                                              |
| `tokenId`              | `uint256`      | The tokenID to place a bid on                                                                  |
| `amount`               | `uint256`      | The amount of currency to bid. If the bid is in ETH, this must match the sent ETH value        |

### End Auction
Once the auction is no longer receiving bids, Anyone may finalize the auction.
This action transfers the NFT to the winner, places the winning bid on the piece, and pays out the auction creator and curator.

| **Name**               | **Type**       | **Description**                                                                                |
|------------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `tokenContract`        | `address`      | The address of the nft contract the token is from                                              |
| `tokenId`              | `uint256`      | The tokenID for the ending auction                                                             |
